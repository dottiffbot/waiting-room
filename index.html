				<h1>about tee</h1>
				<div class="monologue">
				Tee Topor is a human collaborating with machines and people. Although a jester of many trades, they primarily like to design computer generated graphics for the web. Currently they are interested in technologies that complicate our understood realities by being inefficient, messy, and honest. 
				Recently, they were a member of NEW INC, where they participated in the Cooperative Studies track as a member of <a href="https://dutyfreedesign.online/" target="_blank">Duty Free</a>. There, they collaboratively researched and developed<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-wc0qh_05s&t=2104s&ab_channel=NEWINC" target="_blank"> a project</a> that brought into question how we currently value and exchange design services, creative labor, and more generally, our own time. 
				They are a studio member at <a href="https://larpa.solutions/" target="_blank">LARPA</a>, a worker rented studio space that hosts various experimental community events, from dataset karaoke, to algorithmically manipulated screenings of well known films. They are based in NYC, for now.

				<h1>about tee online</h1>
				<div class="monologue">
				Tee is always interested in connecting with and or collaborating with nice people online. Feel free to send them a note at teetopor[at]gmail.com. You can find their old website <a href="https://bozo.services/" target="_blank">here</a>, or their even older website <a href="http://teeaze.world/" target="_blank">here</a>. They also still actively use <a href="https://instagram.com/bozobill" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, for now.

				<h1>about this site</h1>
				<div class="monologue">
					This site is made mostly with vanilla javascript. As you might have guessed, it uses the three.js library, installed with npm and served locally with vite. It is hosted on vercel. The glsl grass was taken and adapted slightly from <a href="https://smythdesign.com/blog/stylized-grass-webgl/" target="_blank">this code</a> by James Smyth. The typefaces on this webpage are  <a href="https://ddott.net/font/aether-mono/" target="_blank">Aether Mono</a>  by DDOTT and <a href="https://charlotterohde.de/typefaces/" target="_blank"> New Edge 666</a> by Charlotte Rohde.
					The song on this website is <a href="https://accretions.bandcamp.com/album/a-small-sun" target="_blank">hidamari awano mix - Remix</a> by Shizka Ueda. Eventually, this site will host documentation of Tee's selected works, but it is a waiting room that makes your computer hot, for now.
					<!-- The chair and clouds were made in Blender. The avatar is called Genly Ai, after the character from Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula Le Guin.  -->
